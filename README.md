# Work Planner
## Description
This app is intended to be used to schedule out a users workday by entering tasks for each hour and saving to their local storage.

If the current hour is greater than the timeslot, those will appear in grey.
If the current hour is less than the timeslot, those will appear in green.
If the current hour is equal to a timeslot, that will appear in red.

## What Was Done
* Modify HTML page and create time blocks
* Build JS page for color-coding rows and saving/retrieving data
* Use localStorage

---
## Process
User can go to page and enter in tasks for working hours.
* When a user clicks the Save button:
    1. Time and task entered are saved into local storage
    2. First question appears, waits for user selection
        * if user chooses correct, score will increase by 1
        * if user chooses incorrect, score does not increase, timer is deducted by 5 seconds
